# 3. CORS Implementation Strategy

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application needs to support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to allow web applications from different domains to access our API securely. We need to implement CORS at both the Nginx reverse proxy level and the application level to ensure proper security and functionality.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a multi-layer CORS strategy:

1. **Nginx Layer CORS Configuration**
   - Dynamic CORS origin validation using Nginx map
   - Whitelist-based approach for allowed origins
   - Pre-flight request handling
   - Standardized CORS headers for all responses
   - Configuration managed through ConfigMap

2. **Headers Configuration**
   - Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Dynamic based on whitelist
   - Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
   - Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, Accept, Origin, X-Requested-With
   - Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 (24 hours)
   - Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, Content-Range

3. **Security Measures**
   - Strict origin validation
   - Pre-flight caching for performance
   - Separate handling for OPTIONS requests
   - Always directive for header inclusion

## Consequences

### Positive
- Secure cross-origin resource sharing
- Flexible origin configuration through ConfigMap
- Improved performance with pre-flight caching
- Centralized CORS management at proxy level
- Standardized header handling
- Easy to add new allowed origins

### Negative
- Additional configuration complexity
- Need to maintain origin whitelist
- Potential for misconfiguration
- Additional processing overhead for CORS checks

### Risks
- Incorrect CORS configuration could block legitimate requests
- Too permissive settings could create security vulnerabilities
- Performance impact from CORS preflight requests
- Potential conflicts between Nginx and application CORS settings

## Additional Notes

- Regular review of allowed origins required
- Monitor for rejected CORS requests
- Update documentation when adding new origins
- Consider implementing automated testing for CORS configuration
- Keep track of browser CORS policy changes
