# 4. OpenTelemetry Implementation

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need comprehensive observability for our application, particularly for tracking user creation flows and overall application performance. OpenTelemetry provides a standardized approach for collecting telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs).

## Decision

We have decided to implement OpenTelemetry with the following configuration:

1. **Core Components**
   - OpenTelemetry Java SDK
   - OpenTelemetry Java Auto-instrumentation
   - OTLP exporter for sending telemetry data
   - Jaeger as the tracing backend
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Loki for logs
   - Grafana for visualization

2. **Instrumentation Points**
   - User creation flow with custom spans
   - Kafka message processing
   - Database operations
   - HTTP endpoints
   - Spring Boot components

3. **Span Configuration**
   - Custom attributes for user operations
   - Error tracking and exception handling
   - Performance metrics
   - Context propagation

4. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Jaeger deployment in Kubernetes
   - OTLP collector configuration
   - Sampling configuration
   - Resource attribution
   - Prometheus scraping
   - Loki log collection

5. **Exporters**
   - Traces → Jaeger via OTLP (14250)
   - Métricas → Prometheus via Actuator (/actuator/prometheus)
   - Logs → Loki via LogbackAppender

## Consequences

### Positive
- Standardized observability implementation
- Detailed transaction tracking
- Better debugging capabilities
- Performance monitoring
- Distributed tracing support
- Cloud-native compatible
- Centralized log management
- Real-time metrics visualization

### Negative
- Additional runtime overhead
- Increased complexity
- Storage requirements for spans
- Learning curve for team
- Resource consumption for log storage
- Network bandwidth for telemetry data

### Risks
- Performance impact from excessive instrumentation
- Data volume management
- Security considerations for traced data
- Resource consumption in production
- Log retention and storage costs
- Network latency for telemetry export

## Additional Notes

- Monitor the performance impact
- Implement proper sampling strategies
- Regular review of traced data for sensitive information
- Consider implementing trace-based alerts
- Keep OpenTelemetry dependencies updated
- Configure appropriate log retention policies
- Monitor storage usage for logs and traces
- Consider implementing log aggregation strategies
