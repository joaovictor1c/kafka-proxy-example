# 1. Initial Architecture Setup

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a scalable and maintainable architecture for our Java application that handles Kafka message processing and user data storage. The system needs to be containerized and deployable to Kubernetes with proper monitoring, scaling, and load balancing capabilities.

## Decision

We have decided to implement the following architecture:

1. **Application Architecture**
   - Spring Boot application for the backend
   - Spring Kafka for message processing
   - Spring Data JPA for database operations
   - MySQL for data persistence
   - Actuator for monitoring and health checks

2. **Container Strategy**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized image size
   - Base image: OpenJDK 17 for runtime
   - Maven-based build process

3. **Kubernetes Architecture**
   - Multi-component deployment:
     - Java application deployment with HPA
     - Nginx reverse proxy layer
     - ConfigMaps for configuration management
     - Services for internal and external access
   - Two-tier load balancing:
     - Nginx LoadBalancer for external access
     - Internal service for pod-to-pod communication

4. **Monitoring and Health**
   - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
   - Nginx health checks
   - Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
   - Resource limits and requests defined

5. **Scaling Strategy**
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU utilization
   - Independent scaling for Nginx and application layers
   - Initial replica count: 2 for both tiers
   - Maximum replica count: 10 for application tier

## Consequences

### Positive
- High availability through multiple replicas
- Automated scaling based on load
- Clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced security through reverse proxy
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified configuration management
- Comprehensive monitoring capabilities

### Negative
- Increased complexity in deployment
- More resources required for running multiple components
- Need for proper monitoring of multiple services
- Additional network hops through Nginx

### Risks
- Potential bottlenecks at the database layer
- Need for proper tuning of HPA parameters
- Possible increased latency due to proxy layer

## Additional Notes

- Regular monitoring of resource usage is required
- Performance testing should be conducted under various load conditions
- Security policies and network policies should be implemented
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures need to be established
