# 2. Nginx Reverse Proxy Implementation

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a robust front-facing layer that can handle load balancing, SSL termination, and provide additional security features. We needed to decide on the best approach for implementing this layer.

## Decision

We have decided to implement Nginx as a reverse proxy with the following configuration:

1. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Using nginx:1.25-alpine as the base image
   - Deployed with 2 replicas for high availability
   - Resource limits:
     - CPU: 200m
     - Memory: 256Mi
   - Resource requests:
     - CPU: 100m
     - Memory: 128Mi

2. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Custom configuration through ConfigMap
   - Upstream backend pointing to Java application service
   - Health check endpoint at /health
   - Custom access and error logging
   - Proper proxy headers configuration

3. **Load Balancing**
   - LoadBalancer service type
   - TCP port 80 exposed
   - Automatic load distribution among application pods

4. **Health Monitoring**
   - Liveness probe at /health endpoint
   - Readiness probe at /health endpoint
   - Initial delay: 5 seconds
   - Check period: 10 seconds

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced security through reverse proxy
- SSL termination capability
- Efficient load balancing
- Simplified certificate management
- Better control over HTTP headers
- Reduced direct exposure of application pods
- Ability to cache static content if needed

### Negative
- Additional network hop
- Need to maintain Nginx configuration
- Extra resources required for Nginx pods
- Potential single point of failure if not properly configured

### Risks
- Configuration complexity might lead to issues
- Need for proper monitoring of Nginx performance
- Potential impact on latency
- SSL certificate management overhead

## Additional Notes

- Monitor Nginx access logs for unusual patterns
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Consider implementing caching strategies
- Regular security audits of Nginx configuration
- Keep Nginx version updated for security patches
