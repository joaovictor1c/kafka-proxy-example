# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Short phrase with ADR number and description
2. **Date**: When the decision was made
3. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
4. **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision
5. **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing
6. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change

## Current ADRs

1. [Initial Architecture](0001-initial-architecture.md)
   - Overall system architecture
   - Container and Kubernetes strategy
   - Scaling and monitoring approach

2. [Nginx Reverse Proxy](0002-nginx-reverse-proxy.md)
   - Nginx implementation details
   - Load balancing strategy
   - Security considerations

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. Copy the template from `template.md`
2. Name it with the next number in sequence: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
3. Update the README.md to include the new ADR
4. Get the ADR reviewed and approved

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: The ADR is under discussion
- **Accepted**: The ADR has been agreed upon and implemented
- **Deprecated**: The ADR is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: The ADR has been replaced by a new ADR
